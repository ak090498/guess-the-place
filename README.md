# guess-the-place
A simple image guesser game where you need to guess the name of the district in West Bengal based on image given randomly based on the array of districts. 
I have used Google Custom Search API to search from the array of districts randomly using the search parameter "q". Currently I am using hardcoded array of districts, later I am planning to get the name of the district from a table of images. For getting the response from API I have used AXIOS api.
